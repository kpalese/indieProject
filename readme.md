### Problem Statement

In recent years, the personal planner industry has expanded quite a bit. Although the traditional planner style (paper printed with daily, weekly, or monthly calendar outlines and then bound together) is still widely available, there is a trend towards planners that allow much more than just tracking the user's schedule. The newer planners allow users to organize items such as goals (e.g. fitness or mindfulness goals), meal planning, chores, and habit tracking. 

The downside to these newer planners is that they are generally large and therefore bulky to carry around. My goal is to create a web application that allows users to track their schedule, goals, and to-do list all in one place without the inconvenience of lugging around a giant paper planner.

Below are two different examples of newer paper planners that serve as some inspiration for my web application:
